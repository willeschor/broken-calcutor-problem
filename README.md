# The Calculator is BUSTED!

This repo is based on the final calculator code that we finished in class.

There are at _least_ 10 different bugs in this code. They can be, but aren't limited to, any of the following:

- Typos
- Incorrect Math
- Incorrect Types (strings/integers)

Your job is make this code work. Find the bugs, fix'em, do some math!
